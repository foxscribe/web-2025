				<p>Hi! My name is Iaroslav, I'm 18. I'm a software developer, amateur artist, musician and writer. In my spare time I also explore video editing and motion graphics. I really like old devices and software and often use them as a working tool.</p>

				<p>I am currently studying software engineering at university. Also, I finished music school in piano class in 2022 and graduated from a lyceum with physics and maths major in 2024. In addition to all that, I'm self-educating: developing my skills in writing stories and composing music, learning Objective-C and Pascal.</p>

				<p>In the past, I have used various UNIX-like systems extensively, including GNU/Linux and BSD distributions. My favourite is Fedora, but I also love Debian and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. At this moment I'm actively using Mac OS X.</p>

				<p>I don't play games often anymore, but I can name some of my favourites: Minecraft, OpenTTD and TIS-100. Maybe someday I will create my own game.</p>

						<div class="block">
							<p>One of my main goals in life is to develop simple software that solves complex problems. I believe that older systems can work just as good as modern, so I'd really like to learn how to create efficent software for 'em - and am actively working on it! Also, I adore self-expression and creativity, so I'm learning digital art in particular and computer graphics as a whole, and maybe someday I'll become pretty good at it. And lastly, I'm thinking about creating a blog, because the Internet has became bloated and heavy, and it could help to make the Interned more about actual people and less algorithms and consuming content again.</p>
